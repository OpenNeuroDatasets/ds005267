## Dataset Overview

This BIDS dataset includes anatomical, fieldmap, and functional MRI data, along with all relevant information and scripts for preprocessing, MVPA (Multivoxel Pattern Analysis), and GLM (General Linear Model) analyses.

### Data Contents

- **Anatomical Data**: High-resolution T1-weighted images.
- **Fieldmap Data**: Fieldmap, magnitude, and phase difference images for correcting distortions.
- **Functional Data**: BOLD images acquired during task performance, with accompanying event files.

### Analyses and Scripts

- **Preprocessing**: Motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial normalization, and smoothing. Scripts are provided in Matlab/SPM.
- **MVPA**: Scripts and methodological details for decoding patterns of brain activity.
- **GLM**: Scripts and details for modeling brain activity in relation to experimental design.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Preprocessing**: Use scripts in `derivatives/preprocessing`.
2. **MVPA Analysis**: Use scripts in `derivatives/MVPA`.
3. **GLM Analysis**: Use scripts in `derivatives/GLM`.

Ensure Matlab and SPM are installed to run the provided scripts.
